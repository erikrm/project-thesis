  abstract = {Over the past three decades, significant developments have been made in hyperspectral imaging due to which it has emerged as an effective tool in numerous civil, environmental, and military applications. Modern sensor technologies are capable of covering large surfaces of earth with exceptional spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Due to these features, hyperspectral imaging has been effectively used in numerous remote sensing applications requiring estimation of physical parameters of many complex surfaces and identification of visually similar materials having fine spectral signatures. In the recent years, ground based hyperspectral imaging has gained immense interest in the research on electronic imaging for food inspection, forensic science, medical surgery and diagnosis, and military applications. This review focuses on the fundamentals of hyperspectral image analysis and its modern applications such as food quality and safety assessment, medical diagnosis and image guided surgery, forensic document examination, defense and homeland security, remote sensing applications such as precision agriculture and water resource management and material identification and mapping of artworks. Moreover, recent research on the use of hyperspectral imaging for examination of forgery detection in questioned documents, aided by deep learning, is also presented. This review can be a useful baseline for future research in hyperspectral image analysis.},

  abstract = {There has been an ever-increasing interest in multi-disciplinary research on multisensor data fusion technology, driven by its versatility and diverse areas of application. Therefore, there seems to be a real need for an analytical review of recent developments in the data fusion domain. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of the data fusion state of the art, exploring its conceptualizations, benefits, and challenging aspects, as well as existing methodologies. In addition, several future directions of research in the data fusion community are highlighted and described.},

  abstract = {It is well-understood that the quality and appropriateness of lighting are critical aspects for creating a quality, robust, and timely vision inspection. In addition to an understanding of illumination types and techniques, geometry, filtering, sensor characteristics, and color, a thorough analysis of the inspection environment, including sample presentation and sample-light interactions, provide a foundation upon which to design an effective vision lighting solution. It is suggested that designing and following a rigorous lighting analysis sequence will provide a consistent, and robust environment, thereby maximizing time, effort, and resources \textendash{}items better used in other critical aspects of vision system design, testing, and implementation.},
