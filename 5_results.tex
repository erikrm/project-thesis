\subsection{Blue cap}
\label{sec:blue_cap_discussion}
The picture of the blue cap will be used as a basement for discussion about the image processing. 

Figure \ref{fig:002_blue_cap_positive_difference} shows what colors in what pixels have gotten more light after the blue cap was introduced. It is of no surprise that blue is the dominant here, but there are also some spots that have a strong white color. 


\subsection{Spectrum of camera}
Figure \ref{fig:relative_reflection_around_zero} shows nine plots, the first one shows the reference spectrum, the spectrum without any objects. The following eight plots shows the Relative Reflectance (\ref{eq:relative_reflectance}), their 




\subsection{Correlating Spectrometer to Camera}

After processing the images and spectrum as shown in figure \ref{fig:correlating_spectrum_and_image}
