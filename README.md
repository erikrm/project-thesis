## Julio Hernandez
Talked with Julio about his ideas for the project. 
He thinks that light intensity and SNR will be major challenges. He wondered i I had considered using multiple fibers to cover the garbage area, this would also help in sectioning of the garbage.
He advises strongly to keep any external light source out, as it will create more noise. He also advises to start building a database as early as possible, be very methodical with the documenting and taking a lot of pictures. We agreed it was best to start with documenting how well the system works for one object, move the object around, divide it into pieces and find out the minimum detection size. Imagine I'm a chemist and document as rigorously as them.

# Add to sources
## Garbage statistics:
### Country recycle, WtE and landfill percentage

### Avfall Norge reports

# Problems with my idea
* Learning camera and spectrometer in the same project is very time consuming. Maybe the focus should have been on one of them. One option is to create a dataset that have spectrometer data as well, but don't analyse it before the master thesis.
