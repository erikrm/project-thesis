## Project description 
### Analysis and processing of visible, infrared, and millimeter wave images


Images in visible (VIS), infrared (IR) or millimeter (MM) wave spectra of waste contain different information about the key parameters used for controlling the waste-to-energy conversion process. Some key parameters such as humidity, may be measured with millimeter wave and quantified with simple image analysis while other parameters such as plastic content, may be measured with visible light and recognized with object and color recognition image processing algorithms. Information extracted from the VIS, IR and MM wave spectra may also be used for sensor fusion to increase signal to ratio in humidity or calorific value measurements.

### Project description
Review characteristic photonic features existing in hyperspectral/multispectral images from different materials and common methods used in image analysis. Combine camera with VIS or IR point spectrometric sensing and conduct experimental work on using photonic response with image analysis methods on simplified material compositions. 
1. Obtain an overview over previous work on recognizing objects with VIS hyper/multispectral imaging.  
2. Review previous work on using VIS hyper/multispectral camera for waste characterization
3. Conduct experimental work by obtaining images and VIS spectra from material compositions containing different colors, shape and size with VIS or IR point spectrometric sensing.  
4. Use the methods reviewed in paragraph 1 and 2 to assess the precision in estimating the material compositions prepared in paragraph 3.
5. Plan field experiments and use the optimized setup developed from paragraph 4. 
6. Compare results from the field tests with the laboratory experiments and reevaluate the assumptions made for the used methods. 


## Julio Hernandez
Talked with Julio about his ideas for the project. 
He thinks that light intensity and SNR will be major challenges. He wondered i I had considered using multiple fibers to cover the garbage area, this would also help in sectioning of the garbage.
He advises strongly to keep any external light source out, as it will create more noise. He also advises to start building a database as early as possible, be very methodical with the documenting and taking a lot of pictures. We agreed it was best to start with documenting how well the system works for one object, move the object around, divide it into pieces and find out the minimum detection size. Imagine I'm a chemist and document as rigorously as them.

What should be recorded then? I always fail at this, I always only record the aspects I think are important at the moment of running the experiment. 
The first set of experiments should be testing of the SNR and object size capabilities of the spectrometer, here I would like to use the camera "merely" for documentation. 
The documentation for this part is:
* A picture
* A spectrogram
  * A video
  * A video spectrogram
* The placement of the fiber and camera
* The placement and size of the objects
* Description of the object. 
* Info about the light source settings and placement. 

This needs to be in a searchable database. 
The question is if I should use both visible and infrared spectrometer. If I can automate the process of gathering data somewhat, which I should do any way, it wont make much difference in work load to include both. Only in preparation time. I should maybe see if I can get a second camera to document the outside of the setup.

# Problems with my idea
* Learning camera and spectrometer in the same project is very time consuming. Maybe the focus should have been on one of them. One option is to create a dataset that have spectrometer data as well, but don't analyse it before the master thesis.
