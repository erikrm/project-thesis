\section{Abstract}
This thesis will describe how to detect parameters in garbage 

Waste is a huge resource that is mostly wasted in todays society. In Norway 39\% is recycled, 57\% is burned for energy (Waste to energy or WtE) and 2\% goes into landfills (??Insert source from readme). This thesis will look into one way of analysing waste before burning. The idea is to use a spectrometer in the visible range combined with a camera to monitor the waste as it is inserted into the waste can. This will allow us to over time find parameters describing the waste, and possibly the objects the waste consists of.
